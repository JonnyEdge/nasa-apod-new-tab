# NASA APoD New Tab Chrome Extension

Chrome Extension using NASA's [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) API to set the background image of every new tab in Chrome â€“ along with a title and brief paragraph explaining what each image is. Turns out NASA's API is slow as all hell, so this is more proof of concept than anything actually usable (depending on how patient you are).
